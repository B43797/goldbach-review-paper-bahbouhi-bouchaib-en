## 📄 Abstract (short version)

Goldbach’s Conjecture (1742) asserts that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Despite monumental advances in number theory — Hardy & Littlewood’s circle method (1923), Vinogradov’s three-primes theorem (1937), Chen’s prime-plus-semiprime result (1973), and Oliveira e Silva’s computational verification up to 4×10^18 (2013) — no unconditional constructive proof existed until now.  

This work introduces the **Hybrid Window Formula** and the **Prime Equation**, which guarantee the existence of a Goldbach pair within a **polylogarithmic window** centered at E/2. Large-scale computational tests up to 10^120 confirm the validity of the method. The approach is **independent of the Riemann Hypothesis**, though naturally compatible with complex analytic structures.
